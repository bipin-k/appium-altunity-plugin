# appium-altunity-plugin

An Appium 2.x plugin for AltUnity Tester. The idea behind this plugin is to make AltUnity Tester completely compatible with Appium, so that an Appium user doesn't need to learn the AltUnity API or download any extra clients or tools.

This plugin is in very early development and not ready for public consumption. This README will be updated when it is, so watch the repo to get notified!
